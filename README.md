The dog and I listen to Marketplace on APM during our walks to the park. The dog doesn't much care for it, but I love it, especially the music interludes.
Marketplace publishes a list of the songs on their daily broadcasts. I found myself adding the songs to a Spotify playlist I listen to at work. Now kai-heart-radio does it for me.

The app scrapes the Marketplace site for new songs, but the Spotify bits are generally applicable to Spotify search and playlist management. 

A template for the config file is provided. To get going, you'll need to first [create a Spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create) and then follow the [Web API Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow) to get yourself an access token.
